Implemented changes:
1. working directory and program file are now separated
2. automatic PHITS run button is added
3. PHITS run automatically generates run folders and keeps run results
4. Results are now separated and input extension change to .inp
5. Source strength can now be defined for RI mode
6. The phantom head position is shown om OpenGL black window as sharp arrow which shows the phantom is facing that particular direction, here it is along positive y-axis
7. Organs tables will be added right after regmesh to guide users
8. RI mode has been set to the default mode of operation
9. program structure and system error handling improved
10. Many bug fixes and performance enhacements
11. GUI stracture and button placements improved
12. Organs tallies were calculated using T-Volume and icntl=14, see volume_computations folder
13. Organ volume must be added to T-deposit
14. correct organ volumes must be added to get results in Gy
15. sumtally needs to be added
16. sumtally separated for different tallied particles
17. automated sumtally script gen and output save
18. manual position entry added
19. position parsing for source and phantom added
20. manual position entry linked with sumtally
21. shielding option turned off for manual entry, note shielding is interactive here and cannot be added to manual entry as it makes the user input very complex and not intuitive.
22. Note that collision detection no longer exist for manual entry, user must debug by themselves or just use graphical input option.
23. CyricPositionPlotter has been developed using qcustomplot GPL and open-source C++ library.
24. user position input parser has been developed to send plotting data to position plotter.
25. plot style and scatter points were added.
26. position cycling along with LCD number counter was implemented.
27. minor bugs fixes to qcustomplot library for newer gcc compiler and qt libs.
28. bug fixes to dymc for manual data entry.
29. TallyPlot has been developed, our custom 2D plotter program.
30. Users must provide the path to organ .out file generated by PHITS into TallyPlot.
31. Bug fixes to the custom TallyPlotter searchtally c++ program.
