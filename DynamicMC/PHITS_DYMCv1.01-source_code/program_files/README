Currently 6 different organs that are;
reg  cell    organ(s)
1     100    left lung
2     101    right lung
3   200 201  heart tissue and blood
4   300-347  spine and discs
5     601    brain
6   604-606  head-face skin

were considered and the reg mesh was used to score the energy deposition in unit of MeV/source.
This tally unit was used so explicit evaluation of volume can be ignored.
This was tested against R-Z mesh and the benchmarking is shown in "regmeshbenchmark" folder.

Reg mesh seem to report volume of 1.00 however even after explicit definition of volumes
NO difference in the tally result in the unit of MeV/source was observed.
